#Code 201, Day 19 Learning Journal
###Friday July 8th, 2016

Friday was a pretty fun day.  We had a short morning where we fixed a couple of small css bugs and put our site live, then went to watch iOS presentations.  There were a couple that really stood out to me, the one for laser cutting the boxes and the one that used the Hue light bulbs.  Really cool ideas, and it's exciting to think that they made those projects in just a week.  

Our presentations were after lunch (pizza) and were also pretty good.  I think ours went pretty well, and so did the ones of the other groups.  Nacho probably had the best theme going, lots of jokes.  

I feel like our Loushootseed project was a little lacking in functionality compared to the other groups..  I coded most of the js myself (with navigators helping) but having several more advanced coders on the other teams gave them a lot more options for neat things to implement.  I'm looking forward to working with more of them going into 301.
