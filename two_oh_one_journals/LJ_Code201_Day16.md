#Code 201, Day 16 Learning Journal
###Tuesday July 5th, 2016

This morning started out with our standup meeting with Sam and Nadia.  We got a good start on our pages main functionality and have the learn page working.  Hooking that up with test.js and getting the export to local storage INTO test.js is the next challenge.  

OK so learn.js is feature complete at this point, and has had a lot of styling work done.  Unfortunately test.js was mostly thrown on the bonfire and we started almost entirely over.  BUT after working on it all afternoon we're most of the way back to features working correctly.  Tomorrow I just have to code in the event listeners and get the clicks applying/removing classes like we want, which will hopefully be done by tomorrow afternoon.  Then it just all comes down to styling and getting the timing of the animations right so they look natural and not jerky.  I imagine that will take some trial and error but we should have pretty much all day Thursday for niggling bits so hopefully that works out as intended.

I'd like to stay for the 6:30pm presentation of the 401 class today but after that time the buses I have to take to get home get pretty sketchy so I really want to be leaving right about that time.  Womp womp.  

###No lecture notes today.
