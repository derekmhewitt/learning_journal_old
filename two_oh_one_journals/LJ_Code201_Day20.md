#Code 201, Day 20 Learning Journal
###Weekend of July 9-10th, 2016

This weekend has mostly been prework for 301.  I finished getting all signed up for the class on Thursday, got into the slack channel for the class on Saturday, and today (Sunday) got into the Canvas for the class.  I started the Code Academy jQuery tutorial yesterday and did some more day, it's interesting but not really that different than what we've been doing so far.  I've been somewhat busy personally this weekend so I haven't had as much time to do tutorials as I would have liked, but I'm sure we'll cover everything that's in them again over the next few days as we get into the groove of a new class.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow, time for a new adventure.  

###No lecture notes today.
